## Network Security Tool

One of the first steps in assessing an environment is to understand the underlying the security infrastructure.  
This tool is designed to:

- **Detect VLANs** – Sends tagged Ethernet frames to check if VLAN tagging is in use, helping to reveal whether traffic segmentation is implemented.  
- **Check Firewalls/Access Control** – Probes common ports (80, 443, 22, 3389) to observe whether responses are filtered, dropped, or allowed, giving insights into firewall rules and access control.  
- **Identify Open Services** – Attempts TCP connections to report which services are running (e.g., web servers, SSH, or remote desktop).  

### Why It Matters
- Verifies segmentation (VLANs)  
- Detects missing or weak firewall rules  
- Maps exposed services that could become attack vectors
